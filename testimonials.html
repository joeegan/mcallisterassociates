   <blockquote> <q>After three years of a complex boundary dispute and alleged party wall issues,
      we had almost decided to abandon our extension. Andrew McAllister was recommended
      by our Architect. Not only did he discover there was no party wall issue, his
      investigation revealed a covenant giving us more land and entitlement. His expert
      knowledge and practical approach swiftly brought clarity to the situation, lifted
      our spirits, and provided a most rewarding outcome. We will be forever grateful to
      Andrew for removing the obstacles we thought immovable. Andrew is the ultimate
      professional and sincerely cares about his clients. We highly recommend his
      services.</q>

   <blockquote> <q>Andrew designed a "raise the roof"
  extension to our 1870's home giving us a magnificent enormous
  bedroom and state of the art bathroom. We had previously employed an Architect who
  failed to gain Planning Permission and another who hadn't seen
  the potential of the project. Andrew did both with remarkable ease, modesty and
  accuracy. The design is totally sympathetic, the Planning department were impressed
  and builders worked with the specification happily.<br/>
  Andrew is an extremely gifted, thorough and responsive Surveyor who we have
  and will continue to recommend with great confidence.</q>
