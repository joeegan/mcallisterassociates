                we had almost decided to abandon our extension. Andrew McAllister was recommended
                by our Architect. Not only did he discover there was no party wall issue, his
                investigation revealed a covenant giving us more land and entitlement. His expert
                knowledge and practical approach swiftly brought clarity to the situation, lifted
                our spirits, and provided a most rewarding outcome. We will be forever grateful to
                Andrew for removing the obstacles we thought immovable. Andrew is the ultimate
                professional and sincerely cares about his clients. We highly recommend his

                their project including drawing up and serving notices to adjoining owners.
                In the event of a dispute arising, we can act in a statutory capacity as
                Party Wall Surveyor for either the building owner or the adjoining owner
                and we will liaise with the other Party Wall Surveyor(s) to agree and serve
                a Party Wall Award under Section 10 of the Act.</p>

            <p>We advise Clients on the application of the Construction (Design & Management)
                Regulations 2007 to their projects and of their statutory duties where
                there project is notifiable. We perform all the statutory functions of

            <h3>Dilapidations</h3>

            <p>We act for both landlords and tenants in claims for damages in relations
                to leasehold property and prepare and seek negotiated settlements in accordance
                with the RICS Guidance and the Dilapidations Protocol. We also act for

            <h3>Commercial Building Surveys</h3>

            <p>The acquisition of commercial premises is one of the most important decisions
                an organisation makes. Our building surveys and technical due diligence
                allow you to make an informed decision and may perhaps influence your negotiation
                of the price, taking into taking account of defects identified in the survey
                or shortcomings in compliance.</p>

            <h3>Civil &amp; Commercial Mediation</h3>

            <p>Mediation is a form of Alternative Dispute Resolution. Parties reach an
                agreement that meets the needs of both parties with the help of a neutral
                facilitator. The courts often require those in dispute to try mediation
                before their case goes before a judge and it is becoming increasingly popular
                as an alternative to more lengthy, costly, and adversarial approaches to
                dispute resolution.</p>

                portfolio management, estate management and maintenance management purposes
                by the building owner or manager. Using the latest digital laser measuring
                equipment and Computer Aided Design technology, we produce plans, elevations
                & sections of existing buildings.</p>

            <p>We can prepare tender documentation and oversee the tendering process.

                contract instructions/variations, appraisal of contractorâs valuations,
                approval of payments, and certification under the specific contract. We
